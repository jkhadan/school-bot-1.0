# Create a function that loops through every 50 minutes (because a period is 50 minutes) and refer to the corresponding
# Dictionary which references the users id with their corresponding classes in a list
# Depending on which iteration we are in the async function loop, we refer to whichever class the person is in

# Commands to be implemented:
# $set <period #> <class>
# $time - returns the amount of time left in the class
# $hwadd adds homework under the class the user is currently in
# $hwclear

# Warning event to send message when the class is halfway through OR when 5 minute is left. Also to alert when the next
# class has started and ended
# possibly a way to turn off these notifications by referring to another list which the user would automatically be
# added to already when they register
# I may need a register command to register a user to the dictionary
